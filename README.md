## Time-series: A primer
This is a very basic introduction into applied time-series using R, based on material coming from "Forecasting & time-series: An applied approach" by Bowerman & O'Connell. Topics that will be covered among others are: simple linear regression, exponential smoothing, ARIMA models, etc, while using R.
