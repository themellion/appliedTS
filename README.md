## Time-series: A primer
This is a very basic introduction into applied time-series using R, based on material coming from "Forecasting & time-series: An applied approach" by Bowerman & O'Connell. Topics that will be covered among others are: simple linear regression, exponential smoothing, ARIMA models, etc, while using R. The structure to follow can be seen below:

1. Introduction
2. Simple linear regression
3. Simple exponential smoothing
4. ARIMA models
5. Forecasting: A case study
