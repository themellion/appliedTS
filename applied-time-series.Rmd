## A few words

This is a very basic introduction into applied time-series using R, based on material coming from "Forecasting & time-series: An applied approach" by Bowerman & O'Connell. Topics that will be covered among others are: simple linear regression, exponential smoothing, ARIMA models, etc. A case study for analysing time series and applying forecasting techniques is also introduced. 

## Outline
1. Introduction
2. Time-series: trend, seasonality and cycles
2. Linear regression
3. Exponential smoothing
4. ARIMA
5. Case-study
