## Introduction
Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) and autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models are part of what is know as the Box-Jenkins methodology which is very useful in forecasting future values of a time-series having values that are statistically dependent upon or related to each other.  
There are several steps involved in applying the Box-Jenkins apprach. Specifically:  

* *identification*
* *estimation*
* *diagnostic checking*
* *forecasting*

The Box-Jenkions approach chooses a particular time-series model to be used from a class of stationary time-series models. Models in this class are either autoregressive models (AR), moving average models (MA), or mixed autoregressive-moving-average models (ARMA). These models are capable of representing both seasonal and non-seasonal time-series. Overall, the Box-Jenkins methodology is capable of accurately forecasting time-series with complicated error structures.  
The regression and exponential smoothing approaches to forecasting assume that the values of the time-series being forecaste are statistically independent of or not related to each other. If the values of the time-series being forecasted are statistically dependent upon or related to each other, then the Box-Jenkins methodology uses the dependency to produce forecasts that are likely to be more accurate than the forecasts produced by the regression and exponential smoothing approaches.  
Regression and exponential smoothing approaches in forecasting, which are presented in the other sections of the course assume that the random error components in the time-series model are statistically independent of each other. 

$$y_t=f(\beta_0,\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_p;t)+\epsilon$$

In such a model, if the successive error-terms are statistically independent, then so are the successive observations of the time-series. However, if the successive error terms are statistically dependent upon each other, then so are the successive observations, and we then call the observations *autocorrelated*. It then follows that accurate forecasting of the time-series can probably best be accomplished by employing a model that express $y_t$ as a function of present and prior random error components, 

$$y_t=\mu+\psi_0\epsilon_t+\psi_1\epsilon_{t-1}+\psi_2\epsilon_{t-2}+\ldots$$
